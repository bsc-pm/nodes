//! \brief Represents a bitset that can be modified concurrently by multiple threads
//!
//! AtomicBitset provides a std::bitset-like class that can be safely modified by multiple
//! threads by providing atomic set and reset operations.
//! It also provides a setFirst function to set the first zero bit, which has some weaker guarantees.
